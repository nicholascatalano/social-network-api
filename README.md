## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list all done through the backend. This application was built using Express.js, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation

To install, first clone the repo to your local computer. Right click on the package.json file and open with integrated terminal. Then run `npm i` to install the necessary node modules. If you'd like to seed the database, then enter `npm run seed` but it isn't necessary. Finally, enter `npm run dev` to run the server using nodemon.
